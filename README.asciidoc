serialport-rs is a general-purpose cross-platform serial port library for Rust. It provides a simple blocking I/O interface to low-level serial ports on POSIX and Windows systems. It reuses code from the https://github.com/dcuddeback/serial-rs[serial-rs] library and aims to provide a very similar interface to that of the https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qserialport.html[QSerialPort] library.

This library was primarily created because I was more familiar with the QSerialPort library and the slow rate of development of the serial-rs library previously mentioned, as I was developing my https://gitlab.com/susurrus/gatii[Gattii] serial terminal emulator program.

This library is licensed under the LGPL version 3.0 or any later version.
